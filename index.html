        <h2>what is it about?</h2>
        <p>I teach programming to kids (age 10-16 years) in Cupertino. Python is the medium for instruction (but it's really less about Python and more about programming). The class runs for 2 hours every Sunday. I limit each class to 5 students.

                <h5>it's about the philosophy</h5>
                <p>I believe that programming is at the intersection of language and mathematics. Hence, the only way to learn programming is by combining how you learn a language and how you learn mathematics. You learn by observing, repeating and practising endlessly.</p>
                <h5>it's also about being a turtle</h5>
                <p>Learning a new language is hard. Learning mathematics is hard. That should tell you how hard it is to learn to program. Being steady is the only sureshot way to learn programming.</p>

                <h5>it's about the philosophy</h5>
                <p>I believe that programming is at the intersection of language and mathematics. Hence, the only way to learn programming is by combining how you learn a language and how you learn mathematics. You learn by observing, repeating and practising endlessly.</p>
                <h5>it's also about being a turtle</h5>
                <p>Learning a new language is hard. Learning mathematics is hard. That should tell you how hard it is to learn to program. Being slow and being steady is the only sureshot way to learn programming.</p>

        <h2>why not turtle programmer?</h2>
        <p>If your time horizon for programming is anything less than 2 years, turtle programmer is not for you.</p>
